Text File Viewer — FastAPI

A simple web application built with FastAPI that allows users to upload a text file and instantly view its content in the browser.
It includes a minimal, clean, user-friendly UI for drag-and-drop uploading, content preview, line numbers, copy, and download options.

How It Works:

1) Select or drag a .txt file
2) Click Upload
3) The backend reads and returns the file content
4) The UI displays it with optional line numbers
